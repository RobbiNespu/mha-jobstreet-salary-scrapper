        <h1>MHA Jobstreet Programming language salary report 2017</h1>
        <h2> What this page is showing?</h2>
        <p>
            this page is showing all the salaries that comes up if you search for a specific term. ofcourse this way of visualizing of
            the data is not accurate. for example for php you can find salaries that are over 24k MYR but when you dig in
            and try to find what kind of job needs php, you end up with jobs like CTO or data scientist that one part of
            requirment is php. but it's not really related to php or you by knowing php you can't end up on qualifying for
            that job. for example knowing php doesn't lead you to have a data scientist job.
            <br/> anyway if you wonder what job lead to this much of salary, you can visit the github repository and view the
            content of
            <b>report</b> folder. all the jobs and related salaries are stored in the json format.
        </p>

        <h2>How to use the charts</h2>
        <p>
            lets first learn about the axis: <br>
            <b>the x axis</b>: showing the salary range, since jobstreet is showing the salaries in range, i decided to keep
            it as it is.
            <br>

            <b>the y axis at left side</b>: it is related to salary and it's in MYR
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>The histogram chart: </b> it's related to histogram only, the histogram is showing how many time a salary
            range observed in the report. it comes handy to know what is the most of the salaries for specific technology.
